Sublime Text 3 as OpenSCAD Editor

The build file will let you "build" the model and "run" or export it to stl.
The SideBar file will let you open openscad files with Openscad and stl with Netfabb (default), from the folder menu.
The only thing you will need to do while working with scad files is Alt-Tab..

This setup assumes you are using Linux.

Not tested but it should work for Sublime Text 2. For Windows users check the documentation on Sublime(http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html) and OpenSCAD(http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html)
